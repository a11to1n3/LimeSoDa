Dataset
^^^^^^^
The dataset contains the following target soil properties and features:

Target Soil Properties:
""""""""""""""""""""""

SOC - Soil Organic Carbon
    * Code: ``SOC_target``
    * Unit: %
    * Protocol: Measured through titration after oxidization of the organic carbon (Walkley & Black 1934)
    * Sampling Date: Unknown month 2000
    * Sampling Depth: 0 - 20 cm

pH
    * Code: ``pH_target``
    * Unit: Unitless
    * Protocol: Measured in water suspension with a glass electrode with unspecified liquid:soil ratio
    * Sampling Date: Unknown month 2001
    * Sampling Depth: 0 - 20 cm

Clay
    * Code: ``Clay_target``
    * Unit: %
    * Protocol: Hydrometer method; separation of the fractions by sieving and sedimentation. Measurement of the separated fractions by weighing the density of the suspension (Gee and Bauder 1979)
    * Sampling Date: Unknown month 2001
    * Sampling Depth: 0 - 20 cm

Groups of Features:
"""""""""""""""""

vis-NIR – Visible and Near Infrared Spectroscopy
    * Number Features: 830
    * Code(s): ``wl_350``, ``wl_352``, ``wl_354`` ... ``wl_2498``
    * Unit: % (Reflectance)
    * Sensing: Infra-red intelligent spectroradiometer-IRIS MkIV (Geophysical and Environmental Research Corporation, New York, USA), on dried samples in the laboratory, spectral range was 350 – 3,000 nm at 2 - 5 nm intervals
    * Processing: Discarding noisy edges of the spectrum (2,458 - 3,000 nm)
    * Sampling Date: Unknown month 2001
    * Spectral Information (After Data Processing):
        * Data Representation: Wavelength (in nm)
        * Spectral Resolution: 2 - 5 nm depending on wavelength range
        * Spectral Range: 350 – 2,498 nm

    # Split into train/test using fold 1
