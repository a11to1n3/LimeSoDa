Target Soil Properties:
""""""""""""""""""""""

SOC - Soil Organic Carbon
    * Code: ``SOC_target``
    * Unit: %
    * Protocol: Determined by the difference of total carbon and inorganic carbon, where total carbon was obtained through elemental analysis by measuring the CO₂ release during dry combustion (DIN ISO 10694) without acid pretreatment and inorganic carbon as 0.12 x the calcium carbonate content, determined by the gas-volumetric Scheibler Method (ISO 10693)
    * Sampling Date: October 2016
    * Sampling Depth: 0 - 30 cm

pH
    * Code: ``pH_target``
    * Unit: Unitless
    * Protocol: Measured in a water suspension with a glass electrode with a 5:1 liquid:soil volumetric ratio (DIN ISO 10390)
    * Sampling Date: October 2016
    * Sampling Depth: 0 - 30 cm

Clay
    * Code: ``Clay_target``
    * Unit: %
    * Protocol: Sieve-Pipette method, measured through fractioning the soil into the sand fractions by sieving, and the silt and clay fractions by sedimentation in water, German adaptation (DIN ISO 11277)
    * Sampling Date: October 2016
    * Sampling Depth: 0 - 30 cm
