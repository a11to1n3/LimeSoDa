Dataset
^^^^^^^
The SC.93 dataset contains soil measurements and features organized in a dataframe with the following properties:

Target Soil Properties:

SOC - Soil Organic Carbon
    * Code: ``SOC_target``
    * Unit: %
    * Protocol: Measured through light absorption after oxidization of the organic carbon in suspension (Tedesco et al. 1995)
    * Sampling Date: December 2016
    * Sampling Depth: 0 - 20 cm

pH
    * Code: ``pH_target``
    * Unit: Unitless
    * Protocol: Measured in water suspension with a glass electrode ratio with a 1:1 liquid:soil volumetric ratio
    * Sampling Date: December 2016
    * Sampling Depth: 0 - 20 cm

Clay
    * Code: ``Clay_target``
    * Unit: %
    * Protocol: Sieve-Pipette method, measured through fractioning the soil into the sand fractions by sieving, and the silt and clay fractions by sedimentation in water (Gee and Bauder 1986)
    * Sampling Date: December 2016
    * Sampling Depth: 0 - 20 cm

Groups of Features:

vis-NIR – Visible and Near Infrared Spectroscopy
    * Number Features: 2,146
    * Code(s): ``wl_355, wl_356, wl_357`` ... ``wl_2500``
    * Unit: % (Reflectance)
    * Sensing: ASD FieldSpec 4 (Analytical Spectral Devices Inc., Boulder, USA), on dried and sieved samples (<2 mm) in the laboratory, spectral range was 355 - 2,500 nm at 3 - 8 nm spectral resolution
    * Processing: Resampling to 1 nm intervals
    * Sampling Date: March 2017
    * Spectral Information (after data processing):
        * Data Representation: Wavelength (in nm)
        * Spectral Resolution: 1 nm
        * Spectral Range: 355 – 2500 nm

Examples
--------

.. code-block:: python

    # Load and explore the dataset
    data = load_dataset("SC.93")
    dataset = data["Dataset"]
    folds = data["Folds"]
    coords = data["Coordinates"]

    # Split into train/test using fold 1
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = split_dataset(
        data=data,
        fold=1,
        targets=["pH_target", "SOC_target", "clay_target"]
    )

    # Calculate model performance
    predictions = model.predict(X_test)
    metrics = calculate_performance(y_test, predictions)
    print(f"R2: {metrics['r2']:.3f}, RMSE: {metrics['rmse']:.3f}")

    # Visualize soil properties
    soil_map = plot_soil_map(data, "pH_target", zoom_start=14)
    soil_map.save("SC93_pH_map.html")
