Dataset
^^^^^^^
The dataset contains the following target soil properties and features:

Target Soil Properties:
""""""""""""""""""""""

SOM - Soil Organic Matter
    * Code: ``SOM_target``
    * Unit: %
    * Protocol: Measured through the weight difference before and after ignition of the soil with additional correction for structural water from clay by using the formula: SOM = LI − 0.46 − 0.047 × clay content (%) (Ekström 1927)
    * Sampling Date: September 2005
    * Sampling Depth: 0 - 20 cm

pH
    * Code: ``pH_target``
    * Unit: Unitless
    * Protocol: Measured in a water suspension with a glass electrode with a 5:1 liquid:soil volumetric ratio
    * Sampling Date: September 2005
    * Sampling Depth: 0 - 20 cm

Clay
    * Code: ``Clay_target``
    * Unit: %
    * Protocol: Sieve-Pipette method, measured through fractioning the soil into the sand fractions by sieving, and the silt and clay fractions by sedimentation in water (Gee and Bauder 1986)
    * Sampling Date: September 2005
    * Sampling Depth: 0 - 20 cm

Groups of Features:
"""""""""""""""""

ERa – Apparent Electrical Resistivity
    * Number of Features: 1
    * Code(s): ``ERa``
    * Unit: Ω m
    * Sensing: EM38 sensor (Geonics Ltd., Mississauga, Canada) with exploration depth of 0 - 150 cm, in-situ
    * Processing: Ordinary Kriging to align sensing- with soil sampling locations
    * Sampling Date: April 2005

vis-NIR – Visible and Near Infrared Spectroscopy
    * Number of Features: 2,081
    * Code(s): ``wl_420``, ``wl_421``, ``wl_422`` ... ``wl_2500``
    * Unit: % (Reflectance)
    * Sensing: FieldSpec Pro FR scanning instrument (Analytical Spectral Devices Inc., Boulder, USA), on dried and sieved samples (<2 mm) in the laboratory, spectral range was 350 – 2,500 nm at 1.4 – 2.0 nm intervals
    * Processing: Discarding noisy edges of the spectrum (350 - 420 nm), resampling to 1 nm intervals
    * Sampling Date: September 2005
    * Spectral Information (After Data Processing):
        * Data Representation: Wavelength (in nm)
        * Spectral Resolution: 1 nm
        * Spectral Range: 420 - 2,500 nm
