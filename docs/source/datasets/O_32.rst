Target Soil Properties:

SOC - Soil Organic Carbon
* Code: SOC_target
* Unit: %
* Protocol: Determined by the difference of total carbon and inorganic carbon, where total carbon was obtained through elemental analysis by measuring the CO2 release during dry combustion (DIN ISO 10694) without acid pretreatment and inorganic carbon as 0.12 x the calcium carbonate content, determined by the gas-volumetric Scheibler Method (ISO 10693)
* Sampling Date: March 2020
* Sampling Depth: 0 - 20 cm

pH
* Code: pH_target
* Unit: Unitless
* Protocol: Measured in CaCl2 suspension with a glass electrode with a 5:1 liquid:soil volumetric ratio (DIN ISO 10390)
* Sampling Date: March 2020
* Sampling Depth: 0 - 20 cm

Clay
* Code: Clay_target
* Unit: %
* Protocol: Sieve-Pipette method, measured through fractioning the soil into the sand fractions by sieving, and the silt and clay fractions by sedimentation in water, German adaption (DIN ISO 11277)
* Sampling Date: March 2020
* Sampling Depth: 0 - 20 cm

Groups of Features:

MIR – Mid Infrared Spectroscopy
* Number Features: 1,637
* Code(s): wn_3800, wn_3797.1, wn_3795.1 ... wn_751.1
* Unit: % (Reflectance)
* Sensing: Handheld MIR spectrometer (Agilent 4300, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, USA), on dried and sieved samples (<2 mm) in the laboratory compressed to soil tablets, spectral range was 5,200 – 650 cm^-1 at 4 - 16 cm^-1 intervals
* Processing: Discarding irrelevant spectral data of the spectrum (5,200 - 3,800 cm^-1) and noisy edges of the spectrum (751.1 - 650 cm^-1), resampling to ~2 cm^-1 intervals
* Sampling Date: March 2020
* Spectral Information (after data processing):
    * Data Representation: Wavenumber (in cm^-1)
    * Spectral Resolution: ~2 cm^-1
    * Spectral Range: 3,800 - 751.1 cm^-1

.. code-block:: python

    # Load and explore the dataset
    data = load_dataset("O.32")
    dataset = data["Dataset"]
    folds = data["Folds"]

    # Split into train/test using fold 1
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = split_dataset(
        data=data,
        fold=1,
        targets=["pH_target", "SOC_target", "clay_target"]
    )

    # Calculate model performance
    predictions = model.predict(X_test)
    metrics = calculate_performance(y_test, predictions)
    print(f"R2: {metrics['r2']:.3f}, RMSE: {metrics['rmse']:.3f}")
