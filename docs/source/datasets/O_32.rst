Dataset
^^^^^^^
The dataset contains the following target soil properties and features:

Target Soil Properties:
""""""""""""""""""""""

SOC - Soil Organic Carbon
    * Code: ``SOC_target``
    * Unit: %
    * Protocol: Determined by the difference of total carbon and inorganic carbon, where total carbon was obtained through elemental analysis by measuring the CO₂ release during dry combustion (DIN ISO 10694) without acid pretreatment and inorganic carbon as 0.12 x the calcium carbonate content, determined by the gas-volumetric Scheibler Method (ISO 10693)
    * Sampling Date: March 2020
    * Sampling Depth: 0 - 20 cm

pH
    * Code: ``pH_target``
    * Unit: Unitless
    * Protocol: Measured in CaCl₂ suspension with a glass electrode with a 5:1 liquid:soil volumetric ratio (DIN ISO 10390)
    * Sampling Date: March 2020
    * Sampling Depth: 0 - 20 cm

Clay
    * Code: ``Clay_target``
    * Unit: %
    * Protocol: Sieve-Pipette method, measured through fractioning the soil into the sand fractions by sieving, and the silt and clay fractions by sedimentation in water, German adaptation (DIN ISO 11277)
    * Sampling Date: March 2020
    * Sampling Depth: 0 - 20 cm

Groups of Features:
"""""""""""""""""

MIR – Mid Infrared Spectroscopy
    * Number of Features: 1,637
    * Code(s): ``wn_3800``, ``wn_3797.1``, ``wn_3795.1`` ... ``wn_751.1``
    * Unit: % (Reflectance)
    * Sensing: Handheld MIR spectrometer (Agilent 4300, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, USA), on dried and sieved samples (<2 mm) in the laboratory, spectral range was 5,200 – 650 cm⁻¹ at 4 - 16 cm⁻¹ intervals
    * Processing: Discarding irrelevant spectral data of the spectrum (5,200 - 3,800 cm⁻¹) and noisy edges of the spectrum (751.1 - 650 cm⁻¹), resampling to ~2 cm⁻¹ intervals
    * Sampling Date: March 2020
    * Spectral Information (After Data Processing):
        * Data Representation: Wavenumber (in cm⁻¹)
        * Spectral Resolution: ~2 cm⁻¹
        * Spectral Range: 3,800 - 751.1 cm⁻¹

    )

    # Fit model and get predictions
    model = LinearRegression()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    predictions = model.predict(X_test)

    # Calculate performance metrics
    r2 = r2_score(y_test, predictions)
    rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions))
    print(f"R-squared: {r2:.7f}")
    print(f"RMSE: {rmse:.7f}")
