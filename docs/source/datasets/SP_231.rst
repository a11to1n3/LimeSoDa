Dataset
^^^^^^^
The dataset contains the following target soil properties and features:

Target Soil Properties:
""""""""""""""""""""""

SOM - Soil Organic Matter
    * Code: ``SOM_target``
    * Unit: %
    * Protocol: Measured through the weight difference before and after ignition
    * Sampling Date: February 2017, December 2017 and February 2018
    * Sampling Depth: 0 - 15 cm

pH
    * Code: ``pH_target``
    * Unit: Unitless
    * Protocol: Measured in water suspension with a glass electrode with a 2.5:1 liquid:soil gravimetric ratio
    * Sampling Date: February 2017, December 2017 and February 2018
    * Sampling Depth: 0 - 15 cm

Clay
    * Code: ``Clay_target``
    * Unit: %
    * Protocol: Sieve-Pipette method, measured through fractioning the soil into the sand fractions by sieving, and the silt and clay fractions by sedimentation in water (Gee and Bauder 1986)
    * Sampling Date: February 2017, December 2017 and February 2018
    * Sampling Depth: 0 - 15 cm

Groups of Features:
"""""""""""""""""

vis-NIR – Visible and Near Infrared Spectroscopy
    * Number of Features: 271
    * Code(s): ``wl_350``, ``wl_355``, ``wl_360`` ... ``wl_1700``
    * Unit: % (Reflectance)
    * Sensing: Mounted vis-NIR spectrometer (SAS3000, Shibuya Seiki Co. Ltd., Ehime Prefecture, Japan), in-situ, spectral range was 320 – 1,700 nm at 1 - 7 nm intervals
    * Processing: Discarding noisy edges of the spectrum (320 - 350 nm), resampling to 5 nm intervals
    * Sampling Date: February 2017, December 2017 and February 2018
    * Spectral Information (After Data Processing):
        * Data Representation: Wavelength (in nm)
        * Spectral Resolution: 1 nm
        * Spectral Range: 350 - 1,700 nm

    # Calculate performance metrics
    r2 = r2_score(y_test, predictions)
    rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions))
    print(f"R-squared: {r2:.7f}")
    print(f"RMSE: {rmse:.7f}")
