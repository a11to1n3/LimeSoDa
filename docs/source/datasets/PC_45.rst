* Sampling Date: November 2004
* Sampling Depth: 0 – 20 cm

Clay
* Code: Clay_target

* Sampling Date: November 2004

Examples
--------

.. code-block:: python

    # Load and explore the dataset
    data = load_dataset("PC.45")
    dataset = data["Dataset"]
    folds = data["Folds"]

    # Split into train/test using fold 1
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = split_dataset(
        data=data,
        fold=1,
        targets=["pH_target", "SOC_target", "clay_target"]
    )

    # Calculate model performance
    predictions = model.predict(X_test)
    metrics = calculate_performance(y_test, predictions)
    print(f"R2: {metrics['r2']:.3f}, RMSE: {metrics['rmse']:.3f}")
