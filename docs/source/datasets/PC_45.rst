Dataset
^^^^^^^
The dataset contains the following target soil properties and features:

Target Soil Properties:
""""""""""""""""""""""

SOC - Soil Organic Carbon
    * Code: ``SOC_target``
    * Unit: %
    * Protocol: Measured through titration after oxidization of the organic carbon (Tyurin 1935)
    * Sampling Date: November 2004
    * Sampling Depth: 0 – 20 cm

pH
    * Code: ``pH_target``
    * Unit: Unitless
    * Protocol: Measured in water suspension with a glass electrode with a 2.5:1 liquid:soil volumetric ratio (MSz-08-0206/2-1978)
    * Sampling Date: November 2004
    * Sampling Depth: 0 – 20 cm

Clay
    * Code: ``Clay_target``
    * Unit: %
    * Protocol: Sieve-Pipette method, measured through fractioning the soil into the sand fractions by sieving, and the silt and clay fractions by sedimentation in water, Hungarian adaptation (MSZ-08-0205-1978)
    * Sampling Date: November 2004
    * Sampling Depth: 0 – 20 cm

    * Processing: None
    * Sampling Date: November 2004
