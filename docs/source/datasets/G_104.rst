Dataset
^^^^^^^
The dataset contains the following target soil properties and features:

Target Soil Properties:
""""""""""""""""""""""

SOC - Soil Organic Carbon
    * Code: ``SOC_target``
    * Unit: %
    * Protocol: Measured through titration after oxidization of the organic carbon (Walkley & Black 1934)
    * Sampling Date: July 2022
    * Sampling Depth: 0 - 20 cm

pH
    * Code: ``pH_target``
    * Unit: Unitless
    * Protocol: Measured in water suspension with a glass electrode with a 2.5:1 liquid:soil volumetric ratio
    * Sampling Date: July 2022
    * Sampling Depth: 0 - 20 cm

Clay
    * Code: ``Clay_target``
    * Unit: %
    * Protocol: Sieve-Pipette method, measured through fractioning the soil into the sand fractions by sieving, and the silt and clay fractions by sedimentation in water (Gee and Bauder 1986)
    * Sampling Date: July 2022
    * Sampling Depth: 0 - 20 cm

Groups of Features:
"""""""""""""""""

DEM – Digital Elevation Model and Terrain Parameters
    * Number of Features: 2
    * Code(s): ``Altitude``, ``Slope``
    * Unit: ``Altitude`` in m, ``Slope`` in °
    * Sensing: Digital elevation model raster (30 m) based on synthetic aperture radar from "Copernicus Open Access Hub"
    * Processing: Calculating ``Slope`` with ``terrain`` function of the raster R-package, extracting DEM values from raster at soil sampling locations
    * Sampling Date: December 2010

RSS – Remote Sensing Derived Spectral Data
    * Number of Features: 12
    * Code(s): ``B01``, ``B02``, ``B03``, ``B04``, ``B05``, ``B06``, ``B07``, ``B08``, ``B8A``, ``B09``, ``B11``, ``B12``
    * Unit: Unitless
    * Sensing: Sentinel-2 bare soil image (Level-2A) from "Copernicus Open Access Hub"
    * Processing: Extracting RSS values from raster at soil sampling locations
    * Sampling Date: July 2022

VI - Vegetation Indices
    * Number of Features: 2
    * Code(s): ``NDVI``, ``GNDVI``
    * Unit: Unitless
    * Sensing: Sentinel-2 Image during vegetative period (Level-2A) from "Copernicus Open Access Hub"
    * Processing: Calculating ``NDVI`` as (B08 - B04) / (B08 + B04) and ``GNDVI`` as (B08 - B03) / (B08 + B03), extracting VI values from raster at soil sampling locations
    * Sampling Date: December 2023

    print(f"R-squared: {r2:.7f}")
    print(f"RMSE: {rmse:.7f}")
