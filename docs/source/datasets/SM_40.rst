Dataset
^^^^^^^
The dataset contains the following target soil properties and features:

Target Soil Properties:

SOC - Soil Organic Carbon
    * Code: ``SOC_target``
    * Unit: %
    * Protocol: Measured through titration after oxidization of the organic carbon following slight adjustments of the Walkley & Black (1934) method (Zbíral et al. 2004)
    * Sampling Date: May 2004
    * Sampling Depth: 0 - 30 cm

pH
    * Code: ``pH_target``
    * Unit: Unitless
    * Protocol: Measured in KCl suspension with a glass electrode with unspecified liquid:soil ratio (Zbíral 2002)
    * Sampling Date: May 2004
    * Sampling Depth: 0 - 30 cm

Clay
    * Code: ``Clay_target``
    * Unit: %
    * Protocol: Hydrometer method, measured through fractioning the soil into the sand fractions by sieving, and the silt and clay fractions by measuring suspension density using a hydrometer following slight adjustments of the Bouyoucos (1927) method
    * Sampling Date: April 2006
    * Sampling Depth: 0 - 30 cm

Groups of Features:

DEM – Digital Elevation Model and Terrain Parameters
    * Number of Features: 2
    * Code(s): ``Altitude, Slope``
    * Unit: ``Altitude`` in m, ``Slope`` in °
    * Sensing: Digital elevation model raster (~2 m) based on LiDAR from "Geoportal of the Czech Office for Surveying, Mapping and Cadastre"
    * Processing: Calculating ``Slope`` with ``terrain`` function of the raster R-package, extracting DEM values from raster at soil sampling locations
    * Sampling Date: Unknown

ERa – Apparent Electrical Resistivity
    * Number of Features: 1
    * Code(s): ``ERa``
    * Unit: Ω m
    * Sensing: EM38 sensor (Geonics Ltd., Mississauga, Canada) drawn by a vehicle with exploration depth of 0 - 75 cm, in-situ
    * Processing: Ordinary Kriging to align sensing- with soil sampling locations
    * Sampling Date: May 2004

.. code-block:: python

    # Load and explore the dataset
    data = load_dataset("SM.40")
    dataset = data["Dataset"]
    folds = data["Folds"]
    coords = data["Coordinates"]

    # Split into train/test using fold 1
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = split_dataset(
        data=data,
        fold=1,
        targets=["pH_target", "SOC_target", "Clay_target"]
    )

    # Calculate model performance
    predictions = model.predict(X_test)
    metrics = calculate_performance(y_test, predictions)
    print(f"R2: {metrics['r2']:.3f}, RMSE: {metrics['rmse']:.3f}")

    # Visualize soil properties
    soil_map = plot_soil_map(data, "pH_target", zoom_start=14)
    soil_map.save("SM40_pH_map.html")
