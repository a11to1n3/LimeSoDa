Dataset
^^^^^^^
The dataset contains the following target soil properties and features:

Target Soil Properties:
""""""""""""""""""""""

SOC - Soil Organic Carbon
    * Code: ``SOC_target``
    * Unit: mmolc dm-3
    * Protocol: Measured through titration after oxidization of the organic carbon (Walkley & Black 1934)
    * Sampling Date: March 2016
    * Sampling Depth: 0 - 20 cm

pH
    * Code: ``pH_target``
    * Unit: Unitless
    * Protocol: Measured in CaCl2 suspension with a glass electrode with a 2.5:1 liquid:soil volumetric ratio
    * Sampling Date: March 2016
    * Sampling Depth: 0 - 20 cm

Clay
    * Code: ``Clay_target``
    * Unit: g dm-3
    * Protocol: Hydrometer method, measured through fractioning the soil into the sand fractions by sieving, and the silt and clay fractions by measuring suspension density using a hydrometer (Bouyoucos 1927)
    * Sampling Date: March 2016
    * Sampling Depth: 0 - 20 cm

Groups of Features:
"""""""""""""""""

vis-NIR – Visible and Near Infrared Spectroscopy
    * Number of Features: 351
    * Code(s): ``wl_431.6``, ``wl_437.4``, ``wl_449.1`` ... ``wl_2153.1``
    * Unit: % (Reflectance)
    * Sensing: vis-NIR spectrometer of former Veris MSP3 (Veris Technologies, Salina, Kansas, USA) which is based on two spectrometers (USB4000, Ocean optics, Largo, FL, USA) for the visible region and (C9914GB, Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan) for the NIR region, on dried and sieved samples (<2 mm) in the laboratory, spectral range was 343 - 2,200 nm at ~5 nm intervals
    * Processing: Discarding noisy edges of the spectrum (343 - 431.6 nm & 2,153.1 - 2,200 nm)
    * Sampling Date: March 2016
    * Spectral Information (After Data Processing):
        * Data Representation: Wavelength (in nm)
        * Spectral Resolution: ~5 nm
        * Spectral Range: 431.6 - 2,153.1 nm
