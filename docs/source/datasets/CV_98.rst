Dataset
^^^^^^^
The dataset contains the following target soil properties and features:

Target Soil Properties:
""""""""""""""""""""""

SOC - Soil Organic Carbon
    * Code: ``SOC_target``
    * Unit: %
    * Protocol: Measured through titration after oxidization of the organic carbon (Walkley & Black 1934)
    * Sampling Date: May - June and September - October 2021
    * Sampling Depth: 0 - 20 cm

pH
    * Code: ``pH_target``
    * Unit: Unitless
    * Protocol: Measured in water suspension with a glass electrode with a 5:1 liquid:soil volumetric ratio (NF ISO 10390)
    * Sampling Date: May - June and September - October 2021
    * Sampling Depth: 0 - 20 cm

Clay
    * Code: ``Clay_target``
    * Unit: %
    * Protocol: Sieve-Pipette method, measured through fractioning the soil into the sand fractions by sieving, and the silt and clay fractions by sedimentation in water (Gee and Bauder 1986)
    * Sampling Date: May - June and September - October 2021
    * Sampling Depth: 0 - 20 cm

Groups of Features:
"""""""""""""""""

vis-NIR – Visible and Near Infrared Spectroscopy
    * Number of Features: 2,151
    * Code(s): ``wl_350``, ``wl_351``, ``wl_352`` ... ``wl_2500``
    * Unit: % (Reflectance)
    * Sensing: vis-NIR spectrometer (PSR+3500, Spectral Evolution, Haverhill, USA), in-situ from Edelman auger (denoted as scantype = a in original dataset publication), spectral range was 350 - 2500 nm at 3 - 8 nm intervals
    * Processing: Resampling to 1 nm intervals
    * Sampling Date: May - June and September - October 2021
    * Spectral Information (After Data Processing):
        * Data Representation: Wavelength (in nm)
        * Spectral Resolution: 1 nm
        * Spectral Range: 350 – 2500 nm

    # Calculate performance metrics
    r2 = r2_score(y_test, predictions)
    rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions))
    print(f"R-squared: {r2:.7f}")
    print(f"RMSE: {rmse:.7f}")
