Details

The CV.98 dataset contains tabular data with the following target soil properties and features:

Target Soil Properties:
""""""""""""""""""""""
* SOC - Soil Organic Carbon
    * Code: SOC_target
    * Unit: %
    * Protocol: Measured through titration after oxidization of the organic carbon (Walkley & Black 1934)
    * Sampling Date: May - June and September - October 2021
    * Sampling Depth: 0 - 20 cm

* pH
    * Code: pH_target
    * Unit: Unitless
    * Protocol: Measured in water suspension with a glass electrode with a 5:1 liquid:soil volumetric ratio (NF ISO 10390)
    * Sampling Date: May - June and September - October 2021
    * Sampling Depth: 0 - 20 cm

* Clay
    * Code: Clay_target
    * Unit: %
    * Protocol: Sieve-Pipette method, measured through fractioning the soil into the sand fractions by sieving, and the silt and clay fractions by sedimentation in water (Gee and Bauder 1986)
    * Sampling Date: May - June and September - October 2021
    * Sampling Depth: 0 - 20 cm

Groups of Features:
"""""""""""""""""
* vis-NIR – Visible and Near Infrared Spectroscopy
    * Number Features: 2,151
    * Code(s): wl_350, wl_351, wl_352 ... wl_2500
    * Unit: % (Reflectance)
    * Sensing: vis-NIR spectrometer (PSR+3500, Spectral Evolution, Haverhill, USA), in-situ from Edelman auger (denoted as scantype = a in original dataset publication), spectral range was 350 - 2500 nm at 3 - 8 nm spectral resolution
    * Processing: Resampling to 1 nm intervals
    * Sampling Date: May - June and September - October 2021
    * Spectral Information (after data processing):
        * Data Representation: Wavelength (in nm)
        * Spectral Resolution: 1 nm
        * Spectral Range: 350 – 2500 nm

Examples
--------

.. code-block:: python

    # Load and explore the dataset
    data = load_dataset("CV.98")
    dataset = data["Dataset"]
    folds = data["Folds"]
    coords = data["Coordinates"]  # Note: No coordinates available for this dataset

    # Split into train/test using fold 1
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = split_dataset(
        data=data,
        fold=1,
        targets=["pH_target", "SOC_target", "clay_target"]
    )

    # Calculate model performance
    predictions = model.predict(X_test)
    metrics = calculate_performance(y_test, predictions)
    print(f"R2: {metrics['r2']:.3f}, RMSE: {metrics['rmse']:.3f}")
