Dataset
^^^^^^^
The SC.50 dataset contains soil measurements and features organized in a dataframe with the following properties:

Target Soil Properties:

SOC - Soil Organic Carbon
    * Code: ``SOC_target``
    * Unit: %
    * Protocol: Measured through titration after oxidization of the organic carbon (Walkley & Black 1934)
    * Sampling Date: November 2013
    * Sampling Depth: 0 – 20 cm

pH
    * Code: ``pH_target``
    * Unit: Unitless
    * Protocol: Measured in water suspension with a glass electrode with a 5:1 liquid:soil volumetric ratio
    * Sampling Date: November 2013
    * Sampling Depth: 0 – 20 cm

Clay
    * Code: ``Clay_target``
    * Unit: %
    * Protocol: Sieve-Pipette method, measured through fractioning the soil into the sand fractions by sieving, and the silt and clay fractions by sedimentation in water, German adaption (DIN ISO 11277)
    * Sampling Date: November 2013
    * Sampling Depth: 0 – 20 cm

Groups of Features:

DEM – Digital Elevation Model and Terrain Parameters
    * Number Features: 2
    * Code(s): ``Altitude, Slope``
    * Unit: ``Altitude`` in m, ``Slope`` in °
    * Sensing: Digital elevation model raster (30 m) based on synthetic aperture radar from "Copernicus Open Access Hub"
    * Processing: Calculating ``Slope`` with ``terrain`` function of the ``raster`` package, extracting DEM values from raster at soil sampling locations
    * Sampling Date: October 2011

ERa – Apparent Electrical Resistivity
    * Number Features: 1
    * Code(s): ``ERa``
    * Unit: Ω m
    * Sensing: LandMapper ERM-02 conductivity meter (Landviser, League City, USA) with exploration depth of 0 - 20 cm, in-situ
    * Processing: None
    * Sampling Date: November 2014

Examples
--------

.. code-block:: python

    # Load and explore the dataset
    data = load_dataset("SC.50")
    dataset = data["Dataset"]
    folds = data["Folds"]
    coords = data["Coordinates"]

    # Split into train/test using fold 1
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = split_dataset(
        data=data,
        fold=1,
        targets=["pH_target", "SOC_target", "clay_target"]
    )

    # Calculate model performance
    predictions = model.predict(X_test)
    metrics = calculate_performance(y_test, predictions)
    print(f"R2: {metrics['r2']:.3f}, RMSE: {metrics['rmse']:.3f}")

    # Visualize soil properties
    soil_map = plot_soil_map(data, "pH_target", zoom_start=14)
    soil_map.save("SC50_pH_map.html")
