Dataset
^^^^^^^
The dataset contains the following target soil properties and features:

Target Soil Properties:
""""""""""""""""""""""

SOC - Soil Organic Carbon
    * Code: ``SOC_target``
    * Unit: %
    * Protocol: Determined by the difference of total carbon and inorganic carbon, where total carbon was obtained through elemental analysis by measuring the CO2 release during dry combustion (DIN ISO 10694) without acid pretreatment and inorganic carbon as 0.12 x the calcium carbonate content, determined by the gas-volumetric Scheibler Method (ISO 10693)
    * Sampling Date: June 2013, May, 2014 and November 2014
    * Sampling Depth: 0 - 20 cm

pH
    * Code: ``pH_target``
    * Unit: Unitless
    * Protocol: Measured in water suspension with a glass electrode with unspecified liquid:soil ratio
    * Sampling Date: June 2013, May, 2014 and November 2014
    * Sampling Depth: 0 - 20 cm

Clay
    * Code: ``Clay_target``
    * Unit: %
    * Protocol: Measured through fractioning the soil into the sand fractions by sieving, and the silt and clay fractions by x-ray sedimentation
    * Sampling Date: June 2013, May, 2014 and November 2014
    * Sampling Depth: 0 - 20 cm

Groups of Features:
"""""""""""""""""

MIR – Mid Infrared Spectroscopy
    * Number Features: 2,489
    * Code(s): ``wn_5397.9``, ``wn_5396``, ``wn_5394`` ... ``wn_599.8``
    * Unit: % (Reflectance)
    * Sensing: VERTEX 70v FT-IR Spectrometer (Bruker Optik, Ettlingen, Germany), on dried and sieved samples (<2 mm) in the laboratory, spectral range was 7,500 - 370 cm^-1 at 0.4 cm^-1 intervals
    * Processing: Discarding irrelevant spectral data of the spectrum (7,500 - 5,397.9 cm^-1) and noisy edges of the spectrum (599.8 - 370 cm^-1)
    * Sampling Date: June 2013, May, 2014 and November 2014
    * Spectral Information (after data processing):
        * Data Representation: Wavenumber (in cm^-1)
        * Spectral Resolution: ~2 cm^-1
        * Spectral Range: 5,397.9 – 599.8 cm^-1

    )

    # Fit model and get predictions
    model = LinearRegression()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    predictions = model.predict(X_test)

    # Calculate performance metrics
    r2 = r2_score(y_test, predictions)
    rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions))
    print(f"R-squared: {r2:.7f}")
    print(f"RMSE: {rmse:.7f}")
