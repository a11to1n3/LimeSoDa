Details
-------

The BC.58 dataset contains soil measurements from a 2.1 hectare agricultural field in British Columbia, Canada. The dataset includes three target soil properties (SOC, pH, and Clay content) along with 13 predictor features derived from digital elevation models (DEM), electrical resistivity (ERa), gamma-ray spectrometry (Gamma), remote sensing (RSS), and vegetation indices (VI). However, due to several data quality concerns including sensor calibration issues and incomplete validation, this dataset may be removed from future releases.

Examples
--------

.. code-block:: python

    # Load and explore the dataset
    data = load_dataset("BC.58")
    dataset = data["Dataset"]
    folds = data["Folds"]
    coords = data["Coordinates"]

    # Split into train/test using fold 1
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = split_dataset(
        data=data,
        fold=1,
        targets=["pH_target", "SOC_target", "clay_target"]
    )

    # Calculate model performance
    predictions = model.predict(X_test)
    metrics = calculate_performance(y_test, predictions)
    print(f"R2: {metrics['r2']:.3f}, RMSE: {metrics['rmse']:.3f}")

    # Visualize soil properties
    soil_map = plot_soil_map(data, "pH_target", zoom_start=14)
    soil_map.save("BC58_pH_map.html")
